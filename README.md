## 🚀 Projects

Here are some of my favorite projects:

- 🎥 **[Realtime water heater monitor](https://github.com/lucianoinso/water-heater-monitor)**: **Machine learning** powered system that monitors a water heater's status by detecting its LED indicator using computer vision. A webcam-connected netbook runs a lightweight Flask server, simulating a passive IP camera feed. The image stream can be accessed over the network. A separate client machine fetches the images, uses a custom-trained model to classify the water heater as ON or OFF in real-time, and visualizes usage trends. Implemented using: **Python**, **Flask**, **OpenCV**, **TensorFlow**, **Pandas** and **Matplotlib**.

- 🎞️ **[Video classification](https://github.com/lucianoinso/video-classification)**: A deep learning project focused on classifying video content using convolutional neural networks. Implemented using: **TensorFlow**.

- 🔢 **[Graph coloring](https://github.com/lucianoinso/GraphColoring)**: A **C** program implementing a greedy algorithm to solve the graph coloring problem efficiently.

- 📝 **[Mental health records system](https://github.com/lucianoinso/horalibrepublic)**: A system that manages medical registries for psychologists, allowing them to record session notes and related data. Built with: **Python**, **Django**, **CSS** and **HTML**.

- 🎲 **[Catan Settlers](https://github.com/lucianoinso/catan-settlers)**: A digital adaptation of the popular board game Settlers of Catan. Built using: **React**.

- 🤖 **[Cryptobot](https://github.com/lucianoinso/cryptobot)**: An automated trading bot for cryptocurrencies with basic strategies and API integrations with Binance and Telegram. Implemented with: **Python**.

- ✍️ **[Handwritten digits classifier](https://github.com/lucianoinso/mnist-digit-classifier)**: A machine learning project that classifies handwritten digits using neural networks trained with the MNIST dataset. Built with: **Python**, **TensorFlow**, and **Javascript** for the frontend.

- 🕹️ **[Pong](https://github.com/lucianoinso/pong)**: The classic Pong game written in **C** using the **Allegro** library.

- 🚀 **[Space shooter](https://github.com/lucianoinso/spaceshooter)**: A space shooter game developed in **C**.

- 🏖️ **[Beach animation](https://github.com/lucianoinso/beach_animation)**: Procedural animation depicting a beach scene, made with **Processing**.

- 🧬 **[Lotka-Volterra model](https://github.com/lucianoinso/LotkaVolterraPy)**: A **Python** simulation of the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model, with visualization and explanations.
